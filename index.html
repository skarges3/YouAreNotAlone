			<p><strong>People say that every cloud has a silver lining. Last year I found it difficult to find mine.</strong> In the summer of 2014 I received a DUI that was a rude awakening that hit pretty hard – and then I got another. Soon after, my girlfriend and I broke up. I became depressed. As time passed I realized I was in a place of my own making and took responsibility for my mistakes as best I could. I decided to make something better of them. Then came the portraits.</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="col intro">
      <p>It had been months since my last big project. I had almost forgotten the feeling that comes with creating and how photography connects people. By nature I am fairly closed off emotionally but through talking about this project and creating these portraits I started to feel the benefits of community. The process and the result helped me gather the strength to fight the urge to fall into lethargy or pessimism.</p>
			</div>	
		<div class="col intro">
			<p>Often we feel set apart from others and completely alone. Depression is dangerous when we can’t see that we are not unique in our hardships, everyone struggles, and that there is comfort in this knowledge. No matter how much we have to endure there are people who have gone through depressions of their own with varying degrees of sadness, anxiety, and pain. I hope this project acts as a reminder that wherever you are in dealing with depression, take comfort in the fact that <strong>You Are Not Alone.</strong></p>

			<p>I went to thirteen schools before I graduated from High School and have lived in six different states. I believe I've become quite adept at talking to people, being friendly, and forming healthy relationships very quickly. In that sense my growing up was fortuitous to say the least.</p>

<p>On the flip side of that, it is the small bits that I notice far more than the loud and easily seen parts. I always have this undertow-ing sense of being alone, a sordid bitterness at everything around me–that at any moment, for all my commitment and care, I'd be gone. That at any moment I'd stop caring as much about the people I care about. I even have problems with this when I'm in the same room with people.</p>

<blockquote>"I don't want to move again. I don't want to move on again."</blockquote>

<p>I've said that a lot. I don't want the parts of me I've given people to be wasted by me never being there. It's a great and a terrible part of me.</p>

			<p>You went to Auburn. It was the farthest apart we had ever lived, yet this is when I saw you the most. Darkness started to slip through the necks of Early Times and the blue started to leave your eyes. You called me from the shadows of your dorm crying, “I just feel so alone.”</p> 

<p>The image flashes every time someone asks me if I knew you were depressed. If you were hurt. If I was surprised.</p> 

<p>Does it matter?</p>

<p>Father Breen talked about butterflies; how they die as caterpillars and are reborn as butterflies or some shit like that. Joe would have laughed. There were tables lining the entrance piled with his things. A stethoscope, a lab coat, Fighting Irish memorabilia, and an array of pictures that outlined the short years of his life. I didn’t recognize him in the pictures from the last year. I found myself staring at the top of his head. I thought about the exit wound.</p> 

<blockquote>No one knew my Joe.</blockquote> 

<p>I felt abandoned. He left me. I wanted to say goodbye. Instead I am staring at a body I don’t recognize in a room full of people that didn’t know us. My Joe. My Joe had light and torment, love and terror that plagued him.</p> 
<p>I just want to hear his voice.</p> 

			<hr>

<p>I saw him as a parallel universe. When we were together we stepped outside of our timelines and snuck into the hollowed spaces where we could be alone.</p>

			<hr>

<p>My protection: a diving bell, which encases me, manipulates pressure, and seals me from the outside. You had one of your own. You let me see it, but you never released the pressure to let me in. I only fogged the plates of glass as I marveled around you. The brevity of our visits throughout the years made it feel like we only had minutes to drink each other in before the next drought. We could only love each other when the string between our two tin cans was taut.</p>
