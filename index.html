			<hr>
			<p>I went to thirteen schools before I graduated from High School and have lived in six different states. I believe I've become quite adept at talking to people, being friendly, and forming healthy relationships very quickly. In that sense my growing up was fortuitous to say the least.</p>

<p>On the flip side of that, it is the small bits that I notice far more than the loud and easily seen parts. I always have this undertow-ing sense of being alone, a sordid bitterness at everything around meâ€“that at any moment, for all my commitment and care, I'd be gone. That at any moment I'd stop caring as much about the people I care about. I even have problems with this when I'm in the same room with people.</p>

<blockquote>"I don't want to move again. I don't want to move on again."</blockquote>

<p>I've said that a lot. I don't want the parts of me I've given people to be wasted by me never being there. It's a great and a terrible part of me.</p>
